"Nand to Tetris" is a project-based course that teaches computer science students how to build a modern computer system from first principles.

Participants start by creating basic logic gates using the Nand gate and gradually progress to designing and implementing a fully functional computer system, including a CPU and an operating system.

The course covers various topics in computer architecture, software development, and digital design, providing a hands-on understanding of how computers work from the ground up.
