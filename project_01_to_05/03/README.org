* Sequential Logic

Up until this point we were concerned with Logic Gates and Chips that are time independent, meaning that they are only dependent on the current inputs. This is called *Combination Logic*.

We now like to introduce *Sequential Logic* where the output depends on the previous inputs as well.

** Time steps

Time will be represented as a discrete sequence of time ($$t = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ...$$).

** Technical implementation

To build a clock, that is giving us discrete time units, we are going to use an oscillator, which is oscillating between on and off at a given rate ($$freq=[H]$$).



** Latch / Data Flip Flop

The most elemetary sequential gate that we can imagine is called a /Latch/ or /Data Flip Flop/. The /Latch/ outputs the input of the previous Time step.
