* Introduction

In the final project of *Part 1* of *FromNandtotetris,* we will be constructing the *Assembler*.

We have in written in length about the *Hack Machine Language* in [[https://github.com/Keisn1/nand-to-tetris-in-go/tree/main/project_01_to_05/04][project 04]] and now it is time to build the piece of software that translates *Hack Machine Language Code* into *Binary Code*.

* How to use it

** Build / Install

You can either build the assembler via =make build-assembler= which puts a binary into =nand-to-tetris-in-go/cmd/hack_assembler/= called =hack_assembler=.

Or you can install the binary into your go-environment via =make install-assembler=

** Compilation


Once you have built the binary, you can use it to compile Hack Machine Language Code, e.g.

#+begin_src shell
hack_assembler project_06_Assembler/test_programs/add.asm
#+end_src

You need to specify a filepath.

If no outfile (=--out=) is provided, it will use the filepath, trim the extension and add extension =hack=.
