#+title: The Assembler

In the last project of *Part 1* of *FromNandtotetris* we are going to build the *Assembler*.

An Assembler takes code written in *Machine Language* (often times called *Assembly*) and is going to translate this code into *Binary Code*.

The heart of the work of building an *Assembler* is to take the analyze [[https://github.com/Keisn1/nand-to-tetris-in-go/blob/main/project_01_to_05/04/README.md#org1f00e47][Instruction set]] and other features of the given *Machine Language*, and write a program that takes as input a file with *Machine language code* and outputs a file with *Binary Code*.
